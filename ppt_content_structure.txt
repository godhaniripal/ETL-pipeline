## Slide 4: Transform (T)

### Data Cleaning Operations:
• **Missing Value Handling**: 
  - Zero-filling for count data (cases, deaths)
  - Interpolation for time-series gaps
  - Forward-fill for static data like population

• **Data Standardization**:
  - Country name harmonization across different sources
  - Date format normalization (ISO 8601 standard)
  - Numeric data type conversion and validation

• **Quality Assurance Checks**:
  - **Consistency Validation**: Ensuring active cases = total cases - deaths - recoveries
  - **Temporal Logic**: Detecting impossible decreases in cumulative counts
  - **Cross-Source Verification**: Comparing data across APIs to identify discrepancies
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods to flag unusual spikes or patterns

### Data Enrichment:
• **Calculated Metrics**: Case fatality rates, cases per million, deaths per million
• **Time-Series Processing**: 7-day and 14-day moving averages for trend smoothing
• **Comparative Analysis**: Growth rates, daily change percentages
• **Geographic Grouping**: Continental and regional aggregations

### Tools Used:
• **Pandas**: Primary data manipulation and analysis framework
• **NumPy**: Mathematical operations and statistical calculations
• **Python**: Custom validation functions and business logic implementation

## Slide 5: Load (L)

### Database Architecture:
• **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust relational database optimized for time-series data
• **Cloud Hosting**: Neon cloud platform for reliability and scalability
• **Schema Design**: Normalized structure with countries and covid_cases tables

### Loading Strategy:
• **Incremental Updates**: Using data hashing to identify changed records only
• **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded loading operations for improved performance
• **Transaction Management**: ACID compliance ensures data integrity during batch operations
• **Index Optimization**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields (country_id, date)

### Performance Optimizations:
• **Database Configuration Tuning**:
  - work_mem increased to 128MB for complex queries
  - maintenance_work_mem set to 256MB for bulk operations
  - effective_cache_size optimized for available system memory

• **Batch Processing**: Grouping operations to minimize database connections
• **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
• **Error Recovery**: Rollback mechanisms for failed transactions

### Output Formats:
• **Database Tables**: Primary storage for application queries
• **CSV Files**: Processed data exports for backup and external analysis
• **API Endpoints**: RESTful access for dashboard and external integrations
